			<p>Paying the cost of attending a prestigious university was often seen as a guarantee of secured employment, professional networking, top faculty, and state of art facilities. But the pandemic has changed the experience for some USC students, who feel the sacrifice is not worth the high cost of tuition. Others, who have made the greatest sacrifices, like Isabel Castillo, say “If USC is your dream school, one way or another, you have to make it happen.”</p>

			<p>Castillo feels this way after she worked three jobs, skipped meals and then spent her free time applying for student aid–just to cover the cost of living while attending USC. To her it was worth it but some students would completely disagree with Castillo, feeling as though they are being ripped off by their institution, especially after returning from an entirely virtual school year.</p>

			<p>Educational experiences around the world were greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting to remote learning was challenging for most students. But for some USC Gould School of Law students, the experience was beyond frustrating given the high cost of tuition.</p>

			<p>During the beginning of the pandemic, a group of students known as “Gould Grievances” attempted to contact the school’s administration to ask for either a tuition freeze or some form of financial reimbursement. The students argued that the school had failed to provide support during the public health crisis. Annenberg Media spoke with students affiliated with “Gould Grievances,” who asked to remain anonymous. </p>

			<p>“I simply don’t know how they can justify a tuition increase when we have no access to resources and our quality of learning is so obviously reduced,” one student said.</p>

			<p>Other top universities such as the University of Chicago freezed its tuition last year, while USC raised its tuition by 3.5 % for the 2020-21 academic year. Georgetown University provided a five percent tuition reduction and peer schools like UCLA created a Law Student Wellness Support Fund, which offered emergency grants up to $1,000. The Daily Trojan reported the university made the decision prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

			<p>The students questioned why the school couldn’t initiate similar measures. “Clearly, schools are within their ability to make exceptions, but USC didn’t even try, which was the most frustrating thing,” said another student.</p>

			<p>In January 2021, The students sent a letter through the Student Bar Association to the dean at USC Gould, Andrew Guzman, and to the board of trustees. The students outlined the challenges of trying to learn at home without access to high-speed internet and not being able to access on-campus resources such as the library.</p>

			<p>The students of “Gould Grievances” were met with no response until this past April when they opened their Instagram page under the same name. The group asked law students to submit anonymous responses about how the pandemic affected them and what their opinions were on the quality of their education.</p>

			<p>Three months later, Guzman responded to the students stating, “our goal is to provide the best student experience whether in person or online. I regret any instances in which you have felt otherwise.” Guzman also stated that USC Gould could not alter the tuition decisions made and announced by the university. Days later, the students also received a letter from the board of trustees stating “at this time, we have no plans to consider a refund or reduction in tuition for Spring 2021 or upcoming semesters.”</p>

			<p>The students said the poor response from the law school is particularly frustrating considering how USC Gould markets itself as a small law school where accessibility is top of mind. USC Gould has around 600 students compared to similarly ranked schools with 1,000 students. </p>

			<p>“They admitted students like us for our leadership ability, our advocacy, our analytical skills … and then when we try, and use those same qualities to advocate for ourselves and other students, we’re just stonewalled.”</p>

			<p>Randolph Beatty, an accounting professor at USC, explained that public institutions are under a lot more political scrutiny than private institutions because they are funded by the public.  “The private schools, by their very nature of being private, are less open with information,” Beatty said. “So it's gonna be very hard for you to find exactly what you want to know.” </p>

			<p>USC is not the only school that is experiencing tuition increases and it is not just private schools either; public and private schools alike are raising prices for tuition. The University of California approved a policy that would be raising tuition by at least 1.5% each year starting with incoming students in fall of 2022. In regards to private schools, on average, tuition is increasing as well. However, USC’s tuition is increasing at a rate that is higher than that average.</p>

			<p>At the end of the day the most prominent number to students is the price it costs them to attend. And at the end of the day they pay, even though most struggle. At USC the price of tuition has reached nearly $2 thousand a unit. The higher that price gets the harder it gets for students to pay. Based on USC’s financial report, the institution relies on their student’s money, but protecting that income does not always seem to be at the top of school’s to-do list.</p>

			<p>After losing the financial support of his family’s business, Suhit Agarwal, an international student from India, suddenly needed a loan to stay enrolled at USC. Agarwal was not able to take out a loan through the school, nor was he able to get a job due to the pandemic. International students are required to submit proof of solvency to pay the tuition in full before they enroll. When these students or their families experience financial difficulties, the support they get from the university is very limited. His only option was to get a loan through a private entity, which required a US cosigner. </p>

			<!-- TKTK INSERT Explainer video-->
			<p>Agarwal described his debt as always “in the back of my head, like a nagging thing.” He is projected to pay his loan within 20 years, if he’s lucky. He’s only one of many international students going through something similar at USC, which is unfortunate for a group who is so financially stimulating for, not only the school they attend, but the economy in general. Foreign students contributed $44.7 billion to the U.S. economy during 2018, according to Reuters citing the U.S. Department of Commerce.</p>

			<p>Again, USC is not the only institution to lack support for the student body’s financial woes, they are simply following a national trend. If they were to decide to go against the grain now, it would have to be their own influence. “We can complain all we want, but at the end of the day they’re the ones that hold the power because if a few students want to stop paying tuition, it’s honestly not that big of a deal for them, because they can always get other students who are willing to pay that price,” said Hana Li, a Senator for the Undergraduate Student Government at USC. </p>

			<p>Until then, the students have no choice but to stay persistent in trying to bring about change. “When we talk about who is going to hold them accountable: it has to be students,” said Nivea Krishnan, who is also a USG Senator. “We need every student advocating so we can create a more accessible institution.” </p>
